## [Project2: The BART](http://project2.nelsonreitz.com)

Live demonstration: [http://project2.nelsonreitz.com](http://project2.nelsonreitz.com)

This project is a fictive website built as an exercice for the [Computer Science E-75](http://cs75.tv) online course. The purpose of this
exercise is to give an introduction to Ajax and third-party APIs.

As per the project [specification](http://cdn.cs75.net/2012/summer/projects/2/project2.pdf), the goal was to build a mashup that would allow users to display the routes of the [BART](https://www.bart.gov) (Bay Area Rapid Transit) on a google map and to show each station's next departures by clicking on their marker. 

#### To do
- Auto-center map on route selection

#### Credits
This project was created using the [jQuery](http://http://jquery.com) library, the [Google maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/web), the [BART API](http://www.bart.gov/schedules/developers/api) and the [Roboto](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto) font by [Christian Robertson](http://christianrobertson.com).
